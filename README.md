# (wr)ong! (Wrong Pong)
*(wr)ong!* or *Wrong Pong* is a pong "clone" but a random event happens every 30 seconds, from adding a third "player" 
that blocks the ball to altering time and space, **in this game everything can happen** (satire).

## The project
(wr)ong! is completely FOSS (Free Open Source Software), this means that all assets, code, etc. used can be freely used
in other projects under the MIT License.
